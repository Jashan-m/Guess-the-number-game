# Number Guessing Game

## Description
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number within a user-defined range, and the player tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides hints to guide the player whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

## Features
- **User-defined range**: Players can set the lower and upper limits for the range of the random number.
- **Hints provided**: After each guess, players receive feedback indicating whether their guess was too high or too low.
- **Guess counter**: The program counts the number of guesses the player makes and displays it when the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the lower and upper limits for the range of the random number.
3. Keep guessing the number until you get it right.
4. Receive feedback after each guess to help you narrow down the correct number.
5. The game ends when you correctly guess the number, and the number of tries is displayed.
